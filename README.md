# Loquacious

v 2.1.2

This is a AI project made up with node.js and crafted by some other tools. It's an artefact that I started to measure out I would say , a pretty nuclear and elemental way to develop AI through the web, by recognizing your speech, etc.

## Quick Start

1. `sudo npm install`
2. `nodemon index.js`
3. Open <http://localhost:5000>

## Developers

If you want to run the latest code from git, here's how to get started:

1. Clone the code:

if you wanna make it quick:

it clone -b development --single-branch https://github.com/.... Dir ..



        git clone git@github.com:...
        cd dir ...
        

Or

        git clone https://github.com/AardvarkLabs/ ....
        cd dir ...

2. Install the theatherflix dependencies

        npm install

3. Build the code

        npm run build

4. Run

        npm start
   or

        node app.js
